# Evaluating_SGANs
This is a project from my course csc413. This is the project for evaluating Sound enchancing GANs in music audio file
If you copy this project for your assignment then you will be plagerizing 
You have been warned

The main idea is to use different GANs architectures and loss metrics to 
compare the architectures with different evaluation metrics

Here is the desciption of the project:
- Different GAN architecture such as Deep Speech Enchancing GAN, Iterative Speech
Enchanment GAN
- Experimented with different GAN loss functions like Departing from Normality, Least Square Metrics and
Wasserstein metric
- Different evaluation techniques like Sound to Noise Ratio, Segmented Sound to Noise Ratio and Peak Sound
to Noise Ratio to give a quantitative evaluation for the results and used spectograms to give a qualitative
evaluation of the different GAN architectures used
